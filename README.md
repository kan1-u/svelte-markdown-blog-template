# Svelte Markdown Blog Template

A Markdown-based blog template developed in Svelte.

## Setup

Set the `base` property in `svelte.config.js` to the repository name.

```javascript
const config = {
    kit: {
        paths: {
            base: '/svelte-markdown-blog-template' // Change to the your repository name.
        }
    }
};
```

## Write Post

The markdown files in `contents` are recognized as posts.

This repository has `sample.md` at the initially.  
You can delete it to create your own posts.

Metadata is always required at the beginning of the markdown file.
